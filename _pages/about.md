Hey there ! Thanks for dropping by !

My name is Edoardo D'Amico and I'm currently pursuing a PhD at the [University College of Dublin](https://www.ucd.ie/) where I am specializing in the field of A.I. with a focus on recommender systems algorithms.

I'm a member of the [Insight Centre for Data Analytics](https://www.insight-centre.org/) and I'm currently working under the supervision of [Prof. Aonghus Lawlor](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kyrXm8EAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Neil Hurley](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Xy75cgsW65QC&hl=en&oi=ao). 

I believe the right **mindset** is key to achieving success in any aspect of life. I embrace challenges and difficulties as opportunities to learn and grow, and in my free time, I indulge in my hobbies and interests such as running and playing guitar while constantly seeking ways to improve myself.

With a strong work ethic and a growth mindset, I am determined to make a meaningful impact in the field of artificial intelligence. Whether it's through my academic or my personal pursuits. 

**I am always striving to be the best version of myself.**
